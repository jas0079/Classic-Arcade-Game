## Description

This is project of a classic arcade game clone (like the good old classic Frogger game) created as a part of Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. It uses html, css and javascript.

## Prologue

Your cat is thirsty, it's a beautiful summerday and he wants to drink. But, his bowl is empty and the only water is the neighbours reservoir. 

It's so hot today, your neighbour went crazy as well as his friends and even the mawlers, like they we're hit by a spell.

Make sure your cat won't run over or hit or you'll loose a life. Remember, you only have 3 lives, not 7 :-).


## How to start

Clone this repository or download all files to fire it up.

## After you fired it up

The goal is to get at the other side and earn 50 points by doing that. When you hit the 700 points barrier, you won.
You can earn more points by collecting gems and stars, laying
around on the grass.

Use your arrow keys to navigate the cat and avoid the landmawlers. Those guys are crazy.

## Final note
